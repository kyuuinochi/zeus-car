Compilation error: SoftPWM.h: No such file or directoryï¼Ÿ
-----------------------------------------------------------


If you get a "Compilation error: SoftPWM.h: No such file or directory" prompt, it means you don't have the ``SoftPWM`` library installed.

Please refer to :ref:`ar_install_library` to install the two required libraries ``SoftPWM`` and ``IRLremote``.


avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 10 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x6e?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If the following message keeps appearing after clicking the Upload button when the board and port have been selected correctly.

.. code-block::

    avrdude: stk500_recv(): programmer is not responding
    avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 1 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x00
    avrdude: stk500_recv(): programmer is not responding
    avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 2 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x00
    avrdude: stk500_recv(): programmer is not responding
    avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 3 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x00

At this point, you need to make sure that the ESP32 CAM is unplugged.

The ESP32-CAM and the Arduino board share the same RX (receive) and TX (transmit) pins. So, when you're uploading code, you'll need to first disconnect the ESP32-CAM to avoid any conflicts or potential issues.
