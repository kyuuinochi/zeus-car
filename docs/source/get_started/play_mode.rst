Play Mode
======================

The play mode is where we pre-upload the code to the Arduino board at the factory, and the Zeus Car can be remotely controlled by APP or remote control once it is turned on.

* :ref:`play_app_control`: You need to install the SunFounder Controller on your mobile or tablet, which allows you to control the Zeus Car in all directions with a joystick widget, as well as speech control, and most importantly, you can see the real-time video streaming taken by the Zeus Car on the APP.

* :ref:`play_remote_control`: We have equipped a simple remote control, just turn on the Zeus Car and you can control it by remote control, which is a good choice for users who want to experience the fun of controlling Zeus Car as soon as possible.
