6. Car Light
==========================


In this project, you will be able to use the remote control to control the RGB light strips on the bottom of the car, making them display different colors.


**How to do?**

#. First check that the **Upload** button is toggled to the side near the motor port.

#. Open the ``6_car_light.ino`` file under the path of ``zeus-car-main\examples\6_car_light``. Or copy this code into Arduino IDE.

#. After the code is uploaded successfully, slide the power switch to ON to start the Zeus Car.

#. Now you can use the numbers 1 to 9 on the remote control to control the car to light up different colors, press 0 to turn off, press |ir_return| to let the car perform a color cycle. Key 1 to 9 corresponding to the color is: red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, purple, pink, white.
