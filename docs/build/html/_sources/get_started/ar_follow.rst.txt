12. Follow
====================

In this project, the same two obstacle avoidance modules and an ultrasonic module will be used, but not for obstacle avoidance, but to follow you.

**How to do?**

#. First check that the **Upload** button is toggled to the side near the motor port.

#. Open the ``12_follow.ino`` file under the path of ``zeus-car-main\examples\12_follow``. Or copy this code into Arduino IDE.

#. After the code is uploaded successfully, slide the power switch to ON to start the Zeus Car.

#. In this case, the Zeus Car will not move if there is nothing in front of it. Whenever you move forward, it will follow you if you stand about 20cm away from it.
